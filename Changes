0.013 2015-01-?? TEODESIAN
    - Remove usage of Types::Serialiser, and use JSON::MaybeXS (odd intermittent errors on testers)

    - Add class usage checks and test for that as author tests
    - Add tests for the server going away, and fix issues encountered therein.
    - Add fatal type checking of inputs for all methods, add test to make sure exceptions thrown correctly
    - Add offset argument to getTestResults call.
    - Add (auto-generated) mock class so we don't have to skip practically all of TestRail-API.t
    - Add getTestResultFieldByName method and relevant tests
    - Add Test::Rail::Parser and App::Prove::Plugin::TestRail so you can upload results
    - Add testrail-report binary for those who want to run on static TAP rather than 'do it live' with prove -P
